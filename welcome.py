    ## Purpose
    This application is designed to support the annotation of bile acid isomers in mass spectrometry data using **sequential MassQL queries**. It extends the functionality of standard MassQL searches by enabling **multi-step spectral pattern queries**, which are particularly useful for distinguishing structurally similar compounds such as bile acids.
    
    ## How It Works
    1. **Input a GNPS FBMN Task ID**: Enter your Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) task ID from GNPS. The MGF file will be downloaded and used to run the queries.
    2. **MassQL Query Execution**:
       - The original MGF will be pre-processed (remove blank scans)
       - The app runs an initial filter on the MGF file using stage 1 queries to remove spectra that do not pass this stage.
       - It then performs a set of secondary, more specific MassQL queries only on the remaining spectra.
    3. **Library Match Integration**: The results from MassQL are merged with GNPS library matches from the FBMN job.
    4. **Classification**: A bile acid classification tree is used to assign query results to specific bile acid subclasses.
    
    ## Features
    - üëì Visual classification of features using an interactive bile acid ontology tree
    - üìö Explore GNPS Library matches and full annotated results
    - üîç Rapid exploration of GNPS jobs using MassQL query patterns
    
    ## Example Dataset
    To explore the functionality without inputting your own data, use the **"Load query example"** checkbox in the sidebar.
